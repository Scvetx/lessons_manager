# workbook

A mobile app for managing students and lessons. This app is created as an example with 2 architecture approaches: BLoC and Stateful widgets.

## Getting Started

In this project you can see user interfaces created with 2 types of state management:

- bloc architecture -
1) lib > ui > screens > courses
                            > course_form_screen.dart
                            > course_view_screen.dart
                            > courses_screen.dart
2) lib > ui > screens > lessons
                            > lesson_form_screen.dart
                            > lesson_view_screen.dart
                            > lessons_screen.dart
3) lib > ui > screens > students
                            > student_form_screen.dart
                            > student_view_screen.dart
                            > students_screen.dart

- stateful widgets -
1) lib > ui > screens > auth
2) lib > ui > screens > profile
